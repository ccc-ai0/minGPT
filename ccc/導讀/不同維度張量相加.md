In numpy and tensorflow it's possible to add matrices (or tensors) of different dimensionality if the shape of smaller matrix is a suffix of bigger matrix. This is an example:

x = np.ndarray(shape=(10, 7, 5), dtype = float)
y = np.ndarray(shape=(7, 5), dtype = float)
For these two matrices operation x+y is a shortcut for:

for a in range(10):
    for b in range(7):
        for b in range(5):
            result[a,b,c] = x[a,b,c] + y[b,c]
